title: Album Recommendations
---

Greetings! Here are some albums I really, really enjoy vaguely catagorized by genres. Feel free to hop on to the [all time favs](fav_albums) page to check out some of my absolute favorites. Note that I want to avoid some household-name-level classics that everybody knows and loves like the Beatles, MJ，*Purple Rain*, etc., since this serves as a list of *recommendations*. Albums in each decade / genre are in alphabetical order.
