title: UGTCS Sp22 Special Topics in Cryptography reading group
---

The reading group will follow an abridged version of offering of Stanford [CS 355](https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs355/21sp/schedule/) Sp21.

Syllabus:

1. Intro to Cryptography
2. Intro to Cryptography cont.
3. Interactive proofs; Zero knowledge
4. Succinct Non-interactive Arguments (SNARGs) from Probabilistic Checkable Proofs; Polynomial commitments
5. Buffer week.
6. Oblivious Transfer; Two-party computation: Yao's garble circuits
7. Secret sharing
8. Multi-party computation
9. Differential privacy
10. Buffer week
11. Private information retrieval
12. Fully Homomorphic Encryption

Each week's content will be based on Section 5-12 of [CS 161's textbook](https://textbook.cs161.org/crypto/) for Week 1 and 2, and the corresponding lecture notes in Stanford CS 355 for the rest. 

Our main references are the readings listed on Stanford CS 355's syllabus. Additional resources that I find helpful/fun (this will be continuously updated):

- Past offerings of Stanford CS 355. Just change the url on their website.
- [Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH_TKbymPv-9NdCIroUSBiA/videos) and [notes](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/15356/lecture_notes.pdf) by [Vipul Goyal](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/)
- Henry Corrigan-Gibb's [class on Cryptosystems](https://6893.csail.mit.edu/)
- Justin Thaler's [book](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.html)

Fun stuff in Stanford CS 355 that are left out (can talk about if we have time)
- OWF => PRG => PRF => PRP => Block Cipher
- Discrete Log
- Elliptic Curves
- Pairing-based Cryptography
- SNARGs from Polynomial commitment + IOP
